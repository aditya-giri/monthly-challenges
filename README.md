# monthly-challenges
Repository containing monthly challenges about quantum computing.

## How it works

These challenges are meant to keep you active and prepared until the next round of the mentorship challenge.  
We release a new question every month. These are open to everybody and you're welcome to try your hand at solving them either individually or as a team.   
- You are free to use any framework that you like, and submit your solutions in any format. Just make sure they're easy to evaluate.

## Tentative Timeline

- We will try and release each challenge on the same date every month.
- You get a month's time to solve each question, but if you wish to have your solution reviewed please aim to submit your solution within the first 2 or 3 weeks. 

### Submission

- Please fork this repository and use that to work on your solutions to the challenges. 
  - Follow the folder structure that you see here. For each challenge, create a folder in your repo called `challenge-xx`, where xx is the challenge number. 
  - Under this folder, create another folder with your github username (all lowercase, separated-by-hyphens). Your solution goes into this directory.
- If you complete a challenge and want to "submit" your solution, raise a Pull Request (PR) from your repo to ours. 
- If your solutions works, we'll merge it to our repo.
- The best ones will be given a shout-out! ðŸ˜ƒ
- Note that if you're working as a team, it is sufficient to submit just one PR.

### Evaluation

- We want this to be a community driven project, so evaluation will be in the form of peer reviews.
- *Please* take some time to go through other solutions and provide your feedback! The only way this will work well is if we learn from each other. 
- If you like a solution, please leave an emoji reaction on the PR. We will probably use this to pick the best submissions.
- We will also send out a poll where you can pick your favorite submission. Please vote!
